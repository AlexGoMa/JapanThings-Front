# Japan Things

Japan Things is a 2'5 weeks project to practise all the technologies and knowlegde learnt in a 3 months bootcamp.

It is a front webpage (deployed in Netlify) that communicates with an API (deployed in Render) that using Mongoose saves and reads data in MongoDB.
Images are first stored in Render and a backup is saved in Firebase.
